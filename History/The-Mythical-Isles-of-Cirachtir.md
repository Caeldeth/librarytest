# The Mythical Isles of Cirachtir
###### _by RatShit in Dark Ages Online: Roleplaying_

## Introduction

The Isles of Cirachtir, once shrouded in myths and legends, are known as a place of mystery and ancient power. Located far to the north, these lands are rich in the history of both the Sionnari and the elder races. Separated from the mainland by treacherous waters, Cirachtir remains largely unexplored by humans, its landscape a strange blend of wild forests, towering cliffs, and the enigmatic ruins of the past.

## The Sionnari Legacy

Cirachtir is often said to be the birthplace of the Sionnari, the fox-like people who have lived in harmony with nature for centuries. They consider Cirachtir sacred, believing that their ancestors communed directly with the gods here, and that this sacred connection still lingers. The Sionnari’s rituals in the Isles are filled with reverence for their origins, the ever-present whisper of ancient spirits, and the watchful eyes of fox-faced effigies carved into the trees. The ruins scattered across Cirachtir are rumored to be the remnants of their once-thriving cities, though some suspect that they predate even the Sionnari’s first settlement.

## The Shadow of Dubhaimid

The Isles of Cirachtir are not without peril. Many claim that the Dubhaimid—the malevolent creatures spawned from the dark—are drawn to the place. Strange shadows can be seen moving through the mist, and unsettling tales abound of travelers disappearing in the night. The Sionnari believe that the darkness here is a test set by their ancestors, a reminder that even the most sacred places can fall into shadow if vigilance falters. Today, only the brave—or perhaps the foolish—venture deep into Cirachtir, armed with nothing but faith and steel to face what might be lurking beyond the veil of reality.
