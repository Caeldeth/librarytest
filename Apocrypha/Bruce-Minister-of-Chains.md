# Bruce, Minister of Chains
### _by HorseShit in Dark Ages Online: Roleplaying_

## The Eternal Reign

For two hundred years, Bruce, the so-called Minister of Chains, ruled over Temuair from his gaudy courtroom—a throne room overflowing with opulence, yet undeniably empty of true substance. His crown, encrusted with gems of questionable taste, sat awkwardly atop his head as though it, too, was tired of his endless reign. It is said that Bruce's authority extended like iron chains, binding not just his subjects but the very essence of Temuair itself. And yet, there was an air of absurdity in his rule. His title, "Minister of Chains," seemed at odds with his appearance—a frail figure draped in velvet and surrounded by lavish, meaningless symbols of power.

## The Gaudy Courtroom

The throne room was a spectacle of excess: tapestries woven with nonsensical scenes hung alongside portraits of Bruce in exaggerated poses of heroism, while the pillars were carved into grotesque, leering faces. Amidst this spectacle, Bruce would sit, coughing incessantly, a wet, raspy hack that echoed through the room. His attention often drifted to the jester—a sad figure tasked with entertaining the court with jokes that hadn’t been funny in decades. Each sputtering cough seemed to punctuate the jester’s pathetic attempts at comedy, as if Bruce's only joy lay in interrupting the performance, turning even his own amusement into a farcical exercise of power. The courtroom was no place of governance—it was a circus, with Bruce its reluctant ringleader.

## The World Descends

Outside the gaudy courtroom, Temuair descended further into chaos, heresy, and sheer nonsense. Laws became little more than punchlines; proclamations were issued for the sake of spectacle rather than order. Nobles and clergy alike abandoned their duties, either too fearful of Bruce's chains or too caught up in their own schemes to care. Whispers of rebellion and bizarre rituals spread through the towns like wildfire, and the line between truth and absurdity blurred beyond recognition. People turned to the most bizarre of beliefs, worshipping rusted chains and performing nonsensical rites, as if to mock Bruce’s dominion over them. The once-great land of Temuair had become a twisted theatre, its people actors in a play that had long since lost its script, while Bruce remained on his throne, coughing, a king of nothing but chaos.
