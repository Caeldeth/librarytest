# A Night in the Shadow of Cirachtir
###### _by ShitRat in Dark Ages Online: Roleplaying_

## The Setting Sun

The sun was setting behind the cliffs of Cirachtir, painting the sky in blazing hues of orange and purple. I had wandered far from my camp, enticed by the promise of adventure hidden within the sprawling woods. The villagers warned me not to venture out alone, especially at dusk, but the thrill of the unknown was irresistible. I had heard stories of ancient Sionnari ruins lying in wait, their secrets untouched for centuries, and I wanted to see them with my own eyes. As darkness crept across the landscape, the wild calls of unseen creatures echoed through the trees, urging me forward.

## Voices in the Fog

Deep in the heart of the forest, a thick fog began to roll in, swirling between the tree trunks like restless spirits. A strange sensation filled the air—a prickling along my skin that made me feel like I was being watched. The tales of the Dubhaimid came flooding back to me, whispered by elders to frighten young ones into obeying curfews. I dismissed them, choosing instead to press on, when suddenly I heard a voice. Soft, lilting, and unmistakably not my own. It spoke in a language I could barely understand—R'lyehian, perhaps. The hairs on my neck stood on end, and I turned, expecting to see another traveler, but the fog revealed nothing but emptiness. My pulse quickened, each heartbeat echoing in my ears.

## The Light of the Ancestors

Panic set in, and I stumbled backward, tripping over a gnarled root. Just as I was about to lose hope, a glimmering light appeared through the fog—flickering and soft, like a firefly on a summer night. I rose to my feet, drawn towards the glow, my fear slowly giving way to an inexplicable sense of peace. The voice was still there, a chorus of whispers, but they no longer spoke words of dread. Instead, it felt like a guide, leading me away from whatever shadows prowled in the dark. I followed the light, and, before I knew it, I found myself back on the path that led to my camp. Looking back, I could no longer see the light, only the deep woods, now silent. Perhaps the Sionnari were right; their ancestors truly did still watch over these lands.
