# The Forgotten Gods of Humanity
### _by OldFrenchWhore in Dark Ages Online: Roleplaying_

Before humanity fled to Temuair, they were not without their own pantheon of divine protectors. Among these were three prominent gods, each representing crucial aspects of human life and the world they called home. However, as Chadul’s darkness spread across their lands, these deities met their demise, sacrificing themselves in a desperate bid to protect their people. Their passing marked the end of an era, leaving behind only fragmented memories and the echoes of what once was.

## Taran, The Radiant Protector

Among the pantheon of human gods that perished before the flight to Temuair, Taran, the Radiant Protector, was the deity of strength and leadership. Taran embodied the essence of human resilience and unity, said to have granted the power of courage to all who sought it. He was portrayed as a figure of blinding light, wielding a great shield to fend off the darkness. His domain included the battlefield, hearth, and the bonds that held communities together. When Chadul's influence began to corrupt their world, it is believed that Taran sacrificed himself, using the last of his power to shield the remnants of humanity from the encroaching abyss. His loss left humanity fragmented, yearning for the sense of unity they once shared.

## Maelis, The Weaver of Dreams

Maelis, often referred to as the Weaver of Dreams, was the goddess of knowledge, dreams, and the boundless potential of the human mind. She was said to dwell in a realm between the waking world and the world of visions, where she spun the threads of human thought into tapestries of wonder. Artists, philosophers, and scholars revered her, believing she whispered inspiration into their minds while they slept. When Chadul's chaos swept through the land, Maelis attempted to guide her followers to a path of salvation, but her visions were twisted into nightmares. Eventually, her spirit was consumed by the dark forces she sought to resist, leaving humanity bereft of her guidance, and casting their minds into confusion and doubt.

## Caor, The Verdant Nurturer

The third god, Caor, the Verdant Nurturer, was the deity of growth, nature, and the cycle of life. She was the embodiment of the earth’s fertility, the one who brought life to crops and nurtured the lands. Caor was often depicted as a gentle figure, adorned with flowers and vines, with a serene smile that promised abundance and peace. Farmers and healers worshipped her, seeking her blessing for fertile harvests and the wellbeing of the sick. However, as Chadul’s darkness spread, it poisoned the lands, and Caor fought a losing battle against the decay. In her final act, she poured all her remaining strength into a single blossom—a symbol of hope—before withering away. Her demise left humanity facing barren fields, stripped of the life-giving warmth that once nourished them.
